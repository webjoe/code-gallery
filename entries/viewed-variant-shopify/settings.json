  "description": "Instead of the standard Shopify Viewed Product snippet, this snippet can be used to also capture variant information for the currently viewed variant and will re-trigger whenever a new variant is selected. Added to Cart is included as well to show how it works with this modified code. The selector \"PRODUCT_OPTION_FORM_SELECTOR\" must be updated to the form in which variant options are selectable in your Shopify store on a product.liquid page (in this example, the form has a the attribute class=\"product-form\"). The selector \"ADDED_TO_CART_BUTTON_SELECTOR\" must be updeated to the selector of your add-to-cart button. If you are implementing this via GTM, you must also remove the \"Categories\" property since it requires liquid tags to render, a new property called \"Tags\" is also included as a fallback should this be the case and you still want to filter based on some categorization for the product."
